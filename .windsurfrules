# Project Rules and Guidelines

## General Guidelines

### 1. Solana Development Tools
- Make frequent use of the following MCP tools for Solana development:
  - **Solana Expert: Ask For Help**: For detailed questions about Solana concepts, APIs, SDKs, and errors
  - **Solana Documentation Search**: For searching official Solana documentation
  - **Solana Anchor Framework Expert**: For Anchor Framework specific questions and implementations

### 2. Code Modification Policy
- **Do not modify Rust programs**: All Rust programs in this project have been audited and should remain unchanged
  - Any essential changes to Rust programs require explicit approval from the security team

  ## Next.js Solana Frontend Rules

### 1. Project Structure
- The frontend aims to integrate the Solana program created under the programs folder. The IDL and Typescript types are located in clients/js/src/idls
- Follow Next.js pages router structure for all frontend components
- Keep blockchain service logic in dedicated service files

### 2. Blockchain Service Pattern
- All Solana interaction functions CAN:
  - Be defined as `const functionName = async (params) => {}`
  - Include proper TypeScript typing for all parameters and return values
  - Export only the functions needed by components at the bottom of the file
  - Handle errors gracefully with try/catch blocks

### Wallet Adapter Integration
- Use the Solana Wallet Adapter library included with the Solana frontend scaffold

### RPC Endpoint Management
- Implement connection pooling to distribute load across multiple RPC endpoints
- Use appropriate commitment levels based on operation requirements
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed RPC requests
- Cache RPC responses when appropriate to reduce endpoint load

### Error Handling and Logging
- Create standardized error handling for all blockchain operations
- Implement proper error classification (user errors vs. system errors)
- Log transaction errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages for common transaction failures

### Testing and Development
- Consider reusing Typescript code under clients and /test/bankrun.ts for the actual frontend also; for example, the SDK folder thereunder was copied and pasted into the web folder for frontend development, and should be favored for reuse
- Create separate configurations for devnet, testnet, and mainnet
- Implement comprehensive testing for all blockchain interactions
- Document all blockchain interaction functions with examples

### Mobile Considerations
- Implement responsive design for all blockchain interaction UI components

### Specifications
Considering checking the specs folder from the root of the project for any additional details on the design and pump.science protocol from which this fork is based.

# Important
Regularly consult the solana_examples folder to consider frontend examples avoiding issues, and remember to use the MCP server for questions when in doubt about Solana practices.
