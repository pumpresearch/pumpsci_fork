# Project Submission for ID 5Hxks7

Completed:
- Forked [program repo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-01-pump-science.git) and refactored to address the H and M vulnerabilities in the [latest audit report](https://code4rena.com/reports/2025-01-pump-science) as fixes were not public.
- Took the time to understand the program structure, configuration, and deploy it on devnet (G9sh8zEyXBzXRhRUj5nwbjQPNaeu1uPE7g5UBRNSs17Y), with notes at deployment.md.
- Started developing a frontend in the /web folder. Web3 interactions remain to do, as deep learning of the modern frameworks is necessary. Investigated the structure of the first transaction, createBondingCurve.
